[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)

  ## Description
  The aim of this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.
  Express.js, Mongoose and MongoDB were the required technologies. Insomnia was used to seed and demonstrate the app.
  As this was a back-end challenge and not deployed, a walkthrough link has been added below.
